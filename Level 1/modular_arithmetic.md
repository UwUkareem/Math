# main idea 
## +, -, *
### congruent
- a%N == b%N -> a and b are congruent -> so we can replace a and b with each other in any modular operation
- we can write it like that ( a â‰¡ b (mod N) )
- a = kN + b 

### modulo operation
- (a+b)%N = ( (a%N) + (b%N) )%N
- (a*b)%N = ( (a%N) * (b%N) )%N

### exponentiation
- a^k %N = ( (a%N) ^ k )%N
