- number of digits = log10(n)  ie log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b)
- gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,b-a)
- Goldbach's conjecture : which is checked for all numbers no more than 10^9, 
1) every even number greater than 4 can be written as the sum of two odd primes.
2) every odd whole number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes
3) in odd if(n-2) is prime so we can make this odd out of only 2 numbers not 3

- gcd(a,b) = x -> a = cx , b = dx -> gcd(c,d) = 1
- number of primes factors of number doesnt exceed log(number)
